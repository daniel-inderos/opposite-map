# Opposite Map

Opposite Map is a web application that allows users to find the antipodal point (exact opposite location) on Earth for any given location.

## Features

- Interactive world map
- Click on any point to place a pin
- Find the exact opposite point on Earth
- Option to use user's current location
- Simple and intuitive user interface

## Files

- `index.html`: The landing page with a welcome message and a link to the main application.
- `map.html`: The main application page containing the interactive map and controls.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser to see the welcome page.
2. Click on "Get Started!" to open the main application (`map.html`).
3. On the map page:
   - Click anywhere on the map to place a pin.
   - Click "Go to Opposite" to see the antipodal point.
   - Alternatively, click "Use My Location" to start from your current location.

## Technical Details

The application appears to use HTML and likely JavaScript (not provided in the given files) to handle the map interactions and calculations. CSS is probably used for styling, but the styles are not included in the provided content.

## Installation

As this is a web-based application, no installation is required. Simply host the HTML files on a web server or open them directly in a web browser.

## Contributing

As this is a basic version of the application, there are several ways it could be enhanced:

1. Implement the JavaScript functionality for map interactions.
2. Add CSS for improved styling and responsiveness.
3. Enhance error handling and user feedback.
4. Add more features, such as saving locations or sharing results.
